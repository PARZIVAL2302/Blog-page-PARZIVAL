        In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.

       The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.

               The Ramsays, India's first family of horror, are synonymous with the supernatural and gore. Through their films and series they introduced India to churails that floated across the screen, ghouls that woke up from eerie graveyards, and houses that buzzed with ghosts.

But few knew that behind the production drama, elaborate sets, and haunting showtunes, there was a more sinister story. For the Ramsays, the supernatural wasn't just stuck to the screens and camera - it creeped into their lives, too.

Alisha Kirpalani, the granddaughter of FU Ramsay, has grown up on stories that question reality and bring a chill to the bone. In time, she, too, followed her family's footsteps and saw through the veil that separates this world and the Other.

From the woman on the highway that Shyam Ramsay met to an eerie and persistent knocking that came from every house that Tanuja Ramsay lived in to Amit Ramsay's unwelcome dead visitor at Lamington House, the original home of the Ramsays, this book has the improbable, bizarre and spine-chilling all parading through its chapters.

               Howard Roark, the protagonist of the story is an architect and a firm opposer of collectivism. It is his firm belief than only an individual's vision can be effective in producing genuine art. Mediocrity in art may get rampant if interference by committees and councils is allowed. The Fountainhead is his journey against tradition and his fight against the system.

Peter Keating, Howard's arch rival has beliefs that are the opposite of Howard.'s There are also others that stand in Howard's way. Dominique Francon, the heroine of the story is shown to emerge as a strong, independent woman as the story develops.

Through much of the book the author has expressed her strong personal views against collectivism through the protagonist. It is a journey of a single person against an entire tradition and system to break free. Will Howard survive the war or will be forced to accept the system?

               In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago

               When Bassanio is in need of money to court his lady love, Portia, he approaches his friend Antonio, a prominent Venetian merchant. Unable to help him financially, Antonio offers to become a guarantor to Bassanio’s moneylender.
Together they go to Shylock, a miserly Jewish moneylender, who agrees to lend him the sum of money on one condition:
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.
What happens when Antonio is unable to repay Shylock?
With memorable and true-to-life characters, Shakespeare’s the Merchant of Venice explores bigotry, prejudice, humanity and justice. Regarded among his great comedies, this bittersweet drama with surprising twists and turns is an anti-Semitic work. Having undergone several adaptations, the play continues to be staged around the world.

         ‘AN INTENSE AND BROODING THRILLER LACED WITH SUPERNATURAL AND KILLER TWISTS’ – THE OBSERVER

A intensely romantic and atmospheric thriller for young adults, full of twists and turns with a simmering supernatural undercurrent. Perfect for fans of Holly Jackson, Karen McManus and Delia Owens’ Where the Crawdads Sing

When seventeen-year-old Grey makes her annual visit to La Cachette, Louisiana – the tiny bayou town that proclaims to be the “Psychic Capital of the World” – she knows it will be different from past years: her childhood best friend Elora went missing several months earlier and no one is telling the truth about the night she disappears.

Grey can’t believe that Elora vanished into thin air any more than she can believe that nobody in a town full of psychics knows what happened. But as she digs into the night that Elora went missing, she begins to realize that everybody in town is hiding something―her grandmother Honey; her childhood crush Hart; and even her late mother, whose secrets continue to call to Grey from beyond the grave.

When a mysterious stranger emerges from the bayou – a stormy-eyed boy with links to Elora and the town’s bloody history – Grey realizes that La Cachette’s past is far more present and dangerous than she’d ever understood. She doesn’t know who she can trust. In a town where secrets lurk just below the surface, and where a murderer is on the loose, nobody can be presumed innocent―and La Cachette’s dark and shallow lies may just rip the town apart.

            We can live without religion, but we cannot survive without love.
Roshan and Soha were not just class-mates and neighbours, but also best friends. They wanted to be together, but the world saw them as a Hindu and a Muslim before everything else.
Roshan failed to convince his father and had to let Soha go. He married Manisha with the hope of moving on, and his life unfolded with a new definition of love. When Anuj was born, theirs was a happy family.
Soha walked back into his life after Roshan lost Manisha to cancer.
History repeats itself after years, but this time, Roshan decides to not give up. His resolve to convince his son brings him to a point where he will have to make a choice.
Will Anuj be able to see someone else in place of his mother?
Will Roshan be able to choose between Anuj and Soha?
Will Soha be able to set herself free of a love she has nurtured all her life?
Everything I Never Told You is a burning reminder that the heart knows no restrictions, and of the boundless power of love.

           When in love, you tend to take each other for granted, and sometimes, that can cost you a lifetime of togetherness . . .
Ronnie knew that his first crush was way out of his league, and yet he pursued and wooed Adira. Shyly and from a distance in the beginning, and more persuasively later. He couldn't believe it when the beautiful Adira actually began to reciprocate, falling in love with him for his simplicity and honesty.

Slowly, as they get close and comfortable with each other, life takes on another hue. From truly magical it becomes routine. There are fights and then making-up sessions-a clash of egos and doubts.

Things begin to change for the worst.

It is too late.
Ronnie and Adira will probably never find their forever after . . .

      “A self-awakening story of love, heartbreak, evolution and eventual discovery of the soul” Times Of India

When we believe in ourselves and our life, do we really get what we look for? Does everything come…eventually?

Between the covers is story of a simple girl, Aarohi. Life is not as simple for her. She is a dreamer and it is some of her dreams which she herself finds weird. While facing heartbreak and finding love with a broken man, Aarohi’s untiring efforts to achieve the grail she sought make her wonder if it is too high for her. The pursuit of her goals is her destiny; one she has to fulfill. Giving up on Rudra and diligently taking her tough profession, she met Dr. Aditya Vardhan.

But was Aditya the man of her dreams?
Did she understand what destiny was trying to tell her through her dreams?
Was she ever able to get over Rudra?
Were her efforts enough to bring success?
Was she The Girl Who Saw It All….?
